# JavaScript-Chrome_Extention
This is a practice project where a chrome extention is made with simple Css, Html and JavaScript. This extention enables the user 
to add the visited tab links and save them for later. Along with this the user can also manually write the links and save them. 
The extention also has a delete button which clears the list.
